# k-spyder-classifier
A machine learning K Nearest Neighbors algorithm used to predict  dataset based on a trained data. The tool was trained to understand the features and classes of different breast cancer tumor (namely Benign and Malignant). After training, the algorithm can be used on a new dataset for a different patient to classify which category they belong to. 

Dependencies:
  - Python 3.5
  - Numpy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
 
 
How to use:
1. Pull or Download and extract the repo to you computer.
2. Open the code file and then run with python IDLE/Spyder or Anaconder

You may change the test set to make a new prediction and see how well the algorithm does.
To change a test set, edit the 'data' variable to different values, and run the program.
